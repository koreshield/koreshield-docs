# Sentry Monitoring

Use Sentry to track errors from your KoreShield deployment and correlate incidents with security events. Sentry is typically configured in your hosting environment and application stack.

## Use Cases

- Error tracking for production proxy traffic
- Incident correlation with request IDs and policy outcomes
- Alerting on deployment regressions

## Configure Sentry in Your Environment

Set the DSN in your runtime environment (example):

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0
```

## Container Deployment (Example)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SENTRY_DSN=$SENTRY_DSN \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  -v $(pwd)/config/config.yaml:/app/config/config.yaml \
  koreshield
```

## Operational Tips

- Add Sentry to your reverse proxy or sidecar if you centralize error capture.
- Correlate errors with Koreshield logs and security events.
- Use `json_logs: true` for structured log ingestion.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing events: confirm DSN is set in runtime environment
- No stack traces: ensure debug symbols are available if needed
- High volume: adjust sampling and alert thresholds

## Next Steps

- Review logging and policy config in [/configuration/](/docs/configuration)
- Add metrics in [prometheus.mdx](prometheus.mdx)
