# Rate Limiting

KoreShield uses Redis for distributed rate limiting and shared statistics. When Redis is enabled, multiple proxy instances can enforce consistent limits.

## Enable Redis

```yaml
redis:
	enabled: true
	url: "redis://localhost:6379/0"
```

## Production Guidance

- Use a managed Redis service with TLS enabled
- Ensure all proxy instances point to the same Redis
- Monitor Redis memory and set appropriate eviction policies

## Validation

- Confirm Redis connectivity in logs at startup
- Load test to verify requests are throttled consistently
