# Production Checklist

Use this checklist before launching KoreShield in production.

## Security

- Set `KORESHIELD_API_KEY` and require it on clients
- Enable `security.policy_enforcement` and choose a `default_action`
- Validate provider keys are stored in a secrets manager

## Configuration

- Use a production `config.yaml` (not the example file)
- Set `json_logs: true` for structured logs
- Set `container_mode: true` for containerized deployments

## Networking

- Terminate TLS at a trusted load balancer
- Restrict inbound access to trusted networks or gateways
- Confirm `/health` is reachable for health checks

## Observability

- Scrape `/metrics` if you use Prometheus
- Configure alerting rules for attack spikes and provider outages
- Validate log shipping to your monitoring stack

## Reliability

- Enable Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Run a load test to validate latency and throughput
- Verify failover behavior if providers are unavailable
