# Policies

Policies define how KoreShield reacts to detected threats. Use `sensitivity` to tune detection strictness and `default_action` to decide what happens when a threat is detected.

## Core Policy Settings

```yaml
security:
	sensitivity: medium
	default_action: block
	features:
		sanitization: true
		detection: true
		policy_enforcement: true
```

## Sensitivity Levels

- `low`: require higher confidence to flag content
- `medium`: balanced for most production use
- `high`: strict detection with fewer false negatives

## Actions

- `allow`: permit traffic without restrictions
- `warn`: allow but log as a security event
- `block`: reject requests that violate policy

## Custom Rules and Lists

- Custom rules are supported through the detection engine DSL
- Allowlists and blocklists can reduce false positives or block known risks
- See [Attack Detection](/docs/features/attack-detection) for rule patterns

## Recommended Defaults

- `sensitivity: medium` for balanced protection
- `default_action: block` for production environments
- Enable `sanitization`, `detection`, and `policy_enforcement`
