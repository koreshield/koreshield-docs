# Security

KoreShield secures LLM traffic by combining sanitization, detection, and policy enforcement in a single proxy layer. This keeps provider API keys server-side and applies the same safeguards to every request.

## Core Capabilities

- Input sanitization to remove unsafe content patterns
- Prompt injection detection with multi-layered rules
- Policy enforcement that blocks or warns on detected threats
- Audit-friendly logging and metrics for monitoring

## How It Works

1. Requests enter the KoreShield proxy
2. Content is sanitized and scanned for threats
3. Policies decide whether to allow, warn, or block
4. Allowed traffic is forwarded to the configured provider
5. Results are logged for monitoring and audit

## Configure Security Defaults

Set defaults in your configuration:

```yaml
security:
	sensitivity: medium
	default_action: block
	features:
		sanitization: true
		detection: true
		policy_enforcement: true
```

## Sensitivity Guidance

- `high`: strict enforcement, best for regulated workloads
- `medium`: balanced defaults for most production use
- `low`: lenient mode for experimentation

## Operational Tips

- Use `json_logs: true` for structured logs in production
- Enable Redis for distributed rate limiting and stats
- Protect the proxy with `KORESHIELD_API_KEY`
