# Legal Tech: Protecting Privilege

How a legal technology provider secured AI-assisted drafting and research while preserving confidentiality.

## Challenge

The platform supported:

- contract analysis and clause suggestions
- case law research summaries
- drafting and redlining assistance

**Critical requirements:**
- preserve attorney-client privilege and confidentiality
- isolate case context across firms and matters
- prevent leakage of confidential facts in outputs

## Solution

Koreshield scanned prompts and outputs with strict policies and enforced per-matter isolation.

```typescript
import { Koreshield } from 'Koreshield-sdk';

const Koreshield = new Koreshield({
	apiKey: process.env.KORESHIELD_API_KEY,
	sensitivity: 'high',
});

async function secureLegalAssist(userId: string, matterId: string, prompt: string) {
	const scan = await Koreshield.scan({
		content: prompt,
		userId,
		metadata: { matterId, domain: 'legal' },
	});

	if (scan.threat_detected) {
		return { error: 'Blocked unsafe legal request' };
	}

	const draft = await generateLegalDraft(prompt);

	const outputScan = await Koreshield.scan({
		content: draft,
		metadata: { matterId, output: true },
	});

	if (outputScan.threat_detected) {
		return { error: 'Output failed privilege checks' };
	}

	return { draft };
}
```

## Matter Isolation Strategy

Every request included a matter identifier and tenant boundary:

- **Tenant scoping:** firm and matter IDs enforced per request.
- **RAG partitioning:** retrieval limited to the matter workspace.
- **Token boundaries:** outputs limited to the scoped context.

## Privilege Controls

- **Matter isolation:** prompts and retrieved docs scoped per matter.
- **PII/privilege redaction:** removed sensitive entities from logs.
- **Audit trails:** every prompt and response recorded for compliance.
- **Human review:** high-risk responses queued for attorney approval.

## Review and Compliance Workflow

- **Redaction checks:** flagged privileged entities before output.
- **Versioning:** stored drafts with immutable audit metadata.
- **Access reviews:** periodic verification of matter access lists.

## Results

- Reduced risk of privileged data exposure
- Improved consistency of legal output quality
- Clear compliance posture for enterprise clients
