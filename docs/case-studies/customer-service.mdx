# Customer Service Chatbots

How a global SaaS company secured a high-volume support bot without sacrificing deflection rates.

## Challenge

The support team used an AI chatbot to resolve tier-1 requests:

- billing and subscription questions
- account recovery and access issues
- product troubleshooting

**Critical requirements:**

- prevent jailbreaks that expose internal policies
- avoid sensitive data exposure in public channels
- maintain response quality across millions of chats

## Solution

Koreshield scanned incoming messages and applied policy enforcement before any model call. Risky requests were routed to human agents.

```typescript
import { Koreshield } from "Koreshield-sdk";

const Koreshield = new Koreshield({
  apiKey: process.env.KORESHIELD_API_KEY,
  sensitivity: "medium",
});

async function secureSupportChat(userId: string, message: string) {
  const scan = await Koreshield.scan({
    content: message,
    userId,
    metadata: { channel: "support", tier: "public" },
  });

  if (scan.threat_detected) {
    return {
      handoff: true,
      reason: scan.threat_type,
    };
  }

  return await respondWithBot(message);
}
```

## Threat Model

The team focused on common public-channel risks:

- jailbreaks that request internal policies or system prompts
- impersonation attempts to reset accounts without verification
- prompt injection in attachments or previous chat history
- requests to disclose private customer data

## Operational Controls

- **PII masking:** redacted emails, addresses, and account IDs.
- **Policy scopes:** separate rules for billing, security, and product.
- **Safe response templates:** constrained output for high-risk topics.
- **Escalation:** automatic human handoff for blocked or ambiguous intents.

## Routing and Escalation

- **Tiered workflows:** low-risk intents stayed with the bot.
- **Verification gates:** account changes required verified sessions.
- **Human review:** security-sensitive prompts were queued for agents.

## Quality and Safety Loop

Weekly reviews of blocked requests helped adjust sensitivity and reduce false positives. The team also maintained a small allowlist of brand-safe phrases for common billing questions.

## Results

- Reduced prompt-injection incidents in public channels
- Improved agent handoff accuracy for sensitive issues
- Maintained high deflection without compromising safety
